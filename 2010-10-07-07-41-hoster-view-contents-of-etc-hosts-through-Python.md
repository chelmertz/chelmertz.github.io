My first 15 lines of python actually does something, it imports all entries in <code>/etc/hosts</code> into a <code>dict</code> (which definition I haven’t figured out one bit).

This will be fun. It’s all taking place at <a href="http://github.com/chelmertz/hoster">github.com/chelmertz/hoster</a>.
