Dammit, Apple is really making me think less of them when trying to put up my first “Hello World” iPhone-app.

Soooo confusing web page with similiarly named links, too many links, no clear “first peace of code -&gt; learn IDE -&gt; test the first app” process layed out. Instead: <strong>HUGE</strong> API available.. A complete mess.
