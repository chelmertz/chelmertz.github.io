<h2>Background</h2>
My new macbook came builtin with an "old"(er) version of vim which apparently was compiled without python and ruby. I want that.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Start by <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">installing xcode</a>, <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homebrew</a>Â and git via <pre><code lang=""bash"">$ brew install git</code></pre>
<h2>Installing custom formula</h2>
Now, since I want vim compiled with python and ruby support (for some plugins), I can not use

<pre><code lang=""bash"">$ brew install vim</code></pre>

so I need a <a href="https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/vim.rb">custom brew formula</a>:

<pre><code lang=""bash"">$ brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/vim.rb</code></pre>
<h2>Tell shell to use correctly compiled vim</h2>
(By default) homebrew installs its programs in /usr/local/bin. But after installing vim via brew in the previous step, I still get this:

<pre><code lang=""bash"">$ which vim
/usr/bin/vim</code></pre>

My solution to using the correct vim, was to prepend /usr/local/bin to $PATH instead of having it somewhere in the middle. Now my $PATH looks like this in my .zshrc:

<pre><code lang=""bash"">export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11/bin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin</code></pre>

and, as evidence:
<pre><pre><code lang=""bash"">$ which vim
/usr/local/bin/vim
$ vim --version | grep +ruby | echo $?
0
$ vim --version | grep +python | echo $?
0</code></pre></pre>

Allright, we're good to go!
