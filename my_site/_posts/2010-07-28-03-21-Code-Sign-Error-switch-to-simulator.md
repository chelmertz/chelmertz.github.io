While getting the HelloWorld app going, I was confronted with a “Code Sign Error”. Basically it ment that the standard setting for compiling was set on “device” (which costs money), switching it to “simulator” made it work allright. Once again, Apple suprises me once again with its insufficient support / error messages.
