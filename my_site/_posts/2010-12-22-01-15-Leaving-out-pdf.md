… or rather - welcome in, pdf!

I just posted a link to a pdf and named it <em>Title of important document here (pdf)</em>.

Is that really necessary anymore? As a Google Chrome user, I don’t really have to bother checking the target of a link anymore because of the built in PDF-reader. It deserves so much cred, it’s unbelievable.

PDF used to be unbearable in web context, now it’s like any other page. Huge thumbs up for making us leave out the “WATCH OUT, PDF INCOMING” warning at each link (ok, starting now..)
