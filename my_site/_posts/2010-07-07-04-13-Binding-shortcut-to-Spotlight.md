I just set the keyboard shortcut for Spotlight to <code>cmd + space</code>, which makes it really unnecessary to really have any icons in the dock:
<ul>
	<li> <code>cmd + space, 'ipho'</code> &lt;— iPhoto</li>
	<li> <code>cmd + space, 'ter'</code> &lt;— terminal</li>
</ul>
and so on..

YAY for Mac’s really nice index!
