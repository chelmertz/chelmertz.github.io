Browsing around the Arc90’s “lab” section a bit more I found this delicious thing, a real eye opener. Meet <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2009/07/09/hashmask-another-more-secure-experiment-in-password-masking/">HashMask</a>.

What am I excited about? Oh nothing, just something that GUARANTEES YOU WON’T MISTYPE YOUR PASSWORD EVER AGAIN.

By displaying the hash of your password with an image, the user will validate her own password in a second and retype it until the image is what she’s learned before.

Amazing.
