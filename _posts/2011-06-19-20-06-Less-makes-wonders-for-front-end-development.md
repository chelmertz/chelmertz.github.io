[Less](http://lesscss.org/) is an extended variant of CSS. Its accompanying website really says it all very concise and I only want to add a +1 to the whole idea of mixins for CSS and hope something like this will inspire those writing the CSS specifications.

You can either include a JS file that parses your rules written in less on page load, or you could compile it on beforehand with for example [lessphp](http://leafo.net/lessphp/docs/).

Bonus: there is [syntax highlighting in vim](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3083474/how-to-make-less-files-to-have-css-syntax-highlight-in-vim) available.
