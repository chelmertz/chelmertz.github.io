<a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a> is an extended variant of CSS. Its accompanying website, <a href="http://lesscss.org/">lesscss.org</a>, really says it all very concise and I only want to add a +1 to the whole idea of mixins for CSS and hope something like this will inspire those writing the CSS specifications.

You can either include a JS file that parses your rules written in less on page load, or you could compile it on beforehand with for example <a href="http://leafo.net/lessphp/docs/">lessphp</a>.

Bonus: there is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3083474/how-to-make-less-files-to-have-css-syntax-highlight-in-vim">syntax highlighting in vim</a> available.
