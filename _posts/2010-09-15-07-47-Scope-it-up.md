Always had an issue with scope and functions like `call()` and `apply()` in javascript - until now.

Two easy-to-read sources are:

- [JavaScript, 5 ways to call a function](http://devlicio.us/blogs/sergio_pereira/archive/2009/02/09/javascript-5-ways-to-call-a-function.aspx)
- [John Resigs app “learn”](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn) which will guide you through an interactive enviroment with _focus_ on one particular feature of javascript at a time. Glorious
