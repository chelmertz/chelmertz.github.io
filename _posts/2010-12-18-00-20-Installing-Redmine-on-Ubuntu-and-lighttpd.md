I just finished the installation of the project tool [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) and will be enjoying using it soon.

However, the official installation hints were far from good, in fact, they previously led me to an aborted installation session. Really annoying.

Instead, I used the perfectly concise and error free guide called:

[Redmine 0.9.3, Ubuntu 9.10, Lighttpd 1.4.x, MySQL 5.1.x - jonathanrobson.me](http://jonathanrobson.me/2010/04/redmine-0-9-3-ubuntu-9-10-lighttpd-1-4-x-mysql-5-1-x)

The only diversion was that I installed the 1.0.4 version of Redmine, which seems to be the latest one.
