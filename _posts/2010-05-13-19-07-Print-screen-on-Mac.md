- _Command+Shift+3_ takes a screenshot of the full screen (or screens if multiple monitors), and save it as a file to the desktop
- _Command+Shift+4_ brings up a selection box so you can specify an area to take a screenshot of, then save it as a file to the desktop
- _Command+Shift+4, then spacebar_, then click a window: takes a screenshot of a window only and saves it as a file to the desktop
