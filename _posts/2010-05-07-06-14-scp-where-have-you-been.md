Until I’ve learned to love `sshfs`, there’s always `scp` to help out when you need to _download something from a remote SSH-connection_.

`scp username@remotehost.com:~/something_interesting.txt ./` works like a charm for downloading `something_interesting` to `pwd` (current dir).

Using Ubuntu before Mac is perfect.
