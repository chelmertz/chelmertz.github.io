Trying out a couple of features at once. I'm postingÂ <strong>https : //gist.github.com / 795682</strong> (without the spaces) on its own row in the posterous editor. Since it's showing a gist, it means the blog post http://blog.posterous.com/posterous-now-supports-traileraddict-embeds-a did not lie. That's a good thing. Now read the gist :)
<script src="https://gist.github.com/795682.js?file=gist_vim.sh"></script>
It basically says that you can edit anything you'd like and post it as a code snippet (or "gist") to github, from within vim. It will save time.
