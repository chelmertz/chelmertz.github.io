Some issues I ran into:

- `man` pages were no longer colored.
  - Workaround: [`export GROFF_NO_SGR=1`](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=287185).
- Switching system theme with `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme prefer-dark` no longer takes effect.
  - No workaround as of yet.
  - Lot's of `xdg-portal` related packages installed and configured back and forth, to no avail.
- Running a simple Ansible playbook no longer works.
  - No workaround as of yet.
  - Missing python package, Ubuntu no longer likes `pip3`. Good, in a way; especially language-specific packages should not really be installed globally.
  - Tried using `uv` for the first time, didn't find the correct invocation.
- Volume up/down buttons didn't work.
  - Installing `pulseaudio` "fixed" it. It was supposed to be a "temporary solution", it probably will be permanent. I guess `pipewire` just needs some configuration and things probably work by accident currently.
- `gedit` is no longer a thing.
    - `gnome-text-editor` is apparently the new thing.
