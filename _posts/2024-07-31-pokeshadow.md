_Pokeshadow_ is a small guessing game. You identify random Pokémon by their silhouette.

When starting a round game, it looks like this:

And when finished:

There's a simple point system in place, which could be extended for giving out hints.

The code is hosted at [https://github.com/chelmertz/pokeshadow](https://github.com/chelmertz/pokeshadow). Nothing notable, simple javascript without dependencies and a github action that deploys the game to itch: [https://wonderwizard.itch.io/pokeshadow](https://wonderwizard.itch.io/pokeshadow) as an HTML5 artifact.
