A couple of weeks ago, I presented how we could use a [tool](https://github.com/looplab/fsm), but failed to trigger any real discussion. Did I really reach out? Probably not.

To address this — instead of doing some ad-hoc screensharing of editor, alt-tab to code examples and browser windows — I figured I should self-organize a bit. Write down some criteria, and refine them after having tested them.

## Checklist

- Sell a need, and then your solution to it.
  - Compare the past and the golden future.
  - No need to explore every non-chosen path, but be prepared for questions.
- Red thread, from start to end. Control the arc.
  - What's the general message, who are you presenting for.
    - It's easiest to avoid audiences of too broad backgrounds, to be able to zoom in on a topic and create a discourse.
- Few takeaways per slide.
  - No lists/multiple paragraphs at a time. Or, bring in one bullet at a time on the same page.
    - Avoid lists, everyone is on different points and it is hard to read and listen at the same time.
  - Avoid a reading audience, better to write a few words and focus on talking.
- Use a proper slideshow tool.
  - Everyone is familiar with the concept. Seeing "pagination" progression is helpful.
  - Answering questions & discussions during the presentation is super simple, since we get right back into the presentation where we left off.
- Large font size (helps small monitors, poor eyesight, crappy resolutions in large crowds), few words per page (helps balance reading vs listening).
- Clear path forward in real life, next steps to take action on.
  - Also helps validate the idea.
  - Could be written first.
- Repeat takeaways.
  - What's the one thing the audience show bring with them?
  - Copy & paste problem statement slide with checkboxes for each sub-problem
- Give credits where credits are due.

## Actual example

Today, I held another presentation (on ephemeral dev. envs). I prepared using the above points, and it was much better received - lots of questions timed together with the topic of the current slide, etc.

The actual slides came out like this:

1. Title
2. Problems now: 1 .., 2 .., 3 ..
3. Solution: x
4. Demo screenrecording
5. Explain what we just saw, in detail
6. Rehash problems from 2., with solutions
7. Next steps/outro/questions/credits
