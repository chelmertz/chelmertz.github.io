Iâ€™m trying to follow the development of an open source CMS called <a href="http://pimcore.org">Pimcore</a> but having a hard time following its development process, the same thing goes for my favorite PHP framework, ZF.

Read my lips: <strong>provide statements in one medium, reflect it elsewhere</strong>

These are all sources for news:
<ul>
	<li>irc</li>
	<li>email lists</li>
	<li>twitter</li>
	<li>forum</li>
	<li>blog</li>
	<li>facebook</li>
	<li>github/jira</li>
	<li>wiki</li>
</ul>
and not least, in official sources quickly multiplies the difficulty of focusing in the right spot. The same thing goes for official sources concerning a submodule/sister of the main project.
