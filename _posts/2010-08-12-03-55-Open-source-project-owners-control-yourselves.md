Iâ€™m trying to follow the development of an open source CMS called [Pimcore](http://pimcore.org) but having a hard time following its development process, the same thing goes for my favorite PHP framework, ZF.

Read my lips: _provide statements in one medium, reflect it elsewhere_

These are all sources for news:

- irc
- email lists
- twitter
- forum
- blog
- facebook
- github/jira
- wiki

and not least, in official sources quickly multiplies the difficulty of focusing in the right spot. The same thing goes for official sources concerning a submodule/sister of the main project.
