Just finished a very simple utility: display a placeholder image when you are doing the "gridding" part of your layout.

CallÂ `<img src="picture-this.php?w=500&h=200&bg=ebd&fg=f00" alt="placeholder" />` and have it display this baby:

<img class="alignnone" title="Placeholder example" src="https://github.com/chelmertz/picture-this/raw/master/picture-this-example-1.png" alt="" width="500" height="200" />

<a href="https://github.com/chelmertz/picture-this">Source code</a> and <a href="http://chelmertz.github.com/picture-this/">project page on github</a>.
