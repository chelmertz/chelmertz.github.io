There seems to be a problem with appimages including electron on Ubuntu 24.04. When starting cursor (0.45.8),  you get error messages like this:

```
feb 06 11:37:24 gamma kernel: audit: type=1400 audit(1738838244.309:315): apparmor="AUDIT" operation="userns_create" class="namespace" info="Userns create - transitioning profile" profile="unconfined" pid=28305 comm="cursor" requested="userns_create" target="unprivileged_userns"

Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /tmp/.mount_cursorbCLhGT/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.

```

To get around this, I created /etc/apparmor.d/cursor with this content:

```
abi <abi/4.0>,
include <tunables/global>

profile cursor /usr/bin/cursor flags=(unconfined) {
    userns,

    # Site-specific additions and overrides. See local/README for details.
    include if exists <local/cursor>
}
``` 

Note that I renamed the appimage file to /usr/bin/cursor, and `chmod +x` it.

After reloading the apparmor configuration with

```sh
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/cursor
```

I could start cursor properly.
