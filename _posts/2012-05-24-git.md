Collection of intermediate but handy git tricks. This post will be updated now and then.

## Apply patch from email

        git am -3 --signoff <name of patch>.patch

## Bisect

`<object id>` could be *master*, *35f1cab* or *v1.4*, for example.

        git bisect start
        git bisect good <object id>
        git bisect bad <object id>
        # test the given revision
        # say if it's bad or not with
        git bisect bad
        # continue this way and exit with
        git bisect reset

## Branch off commit

        git branch new_branch <ref>

## Commit part of diff from a file

        git add -p

## Create emailable patch

        # edit
        # commit
        git format patch origin/master --stdout > my_changes.patch

Where origin/master is the base for references.

## Discard parts of a diff

        git checkout -p
        # is hunk too big? 's' to split it

## Merge commits

If you want to add some changes that you'd want included in the previous un-pushed commit

        git commit -am "just a commit"
        # make changes
        git commit --amend -a

## Move hunk of commit to another commit

        git rebase -i HEAD~2
        # p ...
        # e ... <- edit this
        #edit files
        # git add; git commit --amend; git rebase --continue

## Remove remote branch

        git push <remote> :<branch>

## Show log with patches

        git log -p
        # for a specific file
        git log -p <path>
