Collection of intermediate but handy git tricks. This post will be updated now and then.

## Apply patch from email

```shell
git am -3 --signoff <name of patch>.patch
```

## Bisect

`<object id>` could be *master*, *35f1cab* or *v1.4*, for example.

```shell
git bisect start
git bisect good <object id>
git bisect bad <object id>
# test the given revision
# say if it's bad or not with
git bisect bad
# continue this way and exit with
git bisect reset
```

## Branch off commit

```shell
git branch new_branch <ref>
```


## Commit part of diff from a file

```shell
git add -p
```

## Create emailable patch

```shell
# edit
# commit
git format patch origin/master --stdout > my_changes.patch
```

Where origin/master is the base for references.

## Discard parts of a diff

```shell
git checkout -p
# is hunk too big? 's' to split it
```

## Find common ancestor of different branches

```shell
git merge-base my-feature-branch origin/main
```

Useful to, for example, find all files we touched in the feature branch, Ã  la:

```shell
git diff --stat $(git merge-base my-feature-branch origin/main)
```

## Merge commits

If you want to add some changes that you'd want included in the previous un-pushed commit

```shell
git commit -am "just a commit"
# make changes
git commit --amend -a
```

## Move hunk of commit to another commit

```shell
git rebase -i HEAD~2
# p ...
# e ... <- edit this
#edit files
# git add; git commit --amend; git rebase --continue
```

## Remove remote branch

```shell
git push <remote> :<branch>
```

## Repository root in file system

```shell
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

## Show log with patches

```shell
git log -p
# for a specific file
git log -p <path>
```
