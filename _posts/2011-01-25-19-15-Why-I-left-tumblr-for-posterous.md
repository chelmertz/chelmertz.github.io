I gave Tumblr a go since it’s super duper easy but I guess it’s just a little bit too easy.

Some things that made me leave tumblr:
<ul>
	<li>Bogus search results. Searching for “css” on tumblr: 0 results. Searching through the same, imported, posts on posterous: 4 results. It’s really broken.</li>
	<li>Very limited browsability. On tumblr, you can not browse posts through tags, in fact, you can’t see a list of all tags used.</li>
</ul>
Some things I will miss:
<ul>
	<li>The admin GUI, clean and optimized for quick publishing. This actually concerns all of the tumblr UI, great work</li>
	<li>The bookmarklet, it’s great</li>
	<li>Getting an email response for each support question after a couple of hours tops (still waiting for a couple of responses @ posterous)</li>
	<li>The themes</li>
	<li>A pure markdown setting</li>
</ul>
… hopefully I’ll be staying at posterous for a while, otherwise I guess it’s wordpress' turn.
