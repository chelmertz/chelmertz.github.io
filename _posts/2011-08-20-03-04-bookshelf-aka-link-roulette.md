When I want to kill a minute or two online, there are a couple of pages that you _have to_ visit once in a while. **bookshelf** takes away your decision making and loads up one of your favorites straight away.

I do believe it's mac only, since it uses the `open`-command.

Check out the project page for syntax & source: https://github.com/chelmertz/bookshelf
