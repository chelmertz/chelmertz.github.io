Screen could be used as `nohup` with the additional possibility of attaching to the terminal session again, once your ssh session was aborted (or equivalent).

- `screen`- Create a new screen
- `screen -S name`- Create a new screen named "name"
- `screen -ls`- List screens
- `screen -D`- Detach from screen
- `screen -r`- Attach to the single existing screen
- `screen -r 4262`- Attach to the detached screen with pid 4262
- `screen -x 4262`- Reattach to the attached screen with pid 4262
- `ctrl+a c` - Create a new terminal in the current screen
- `ctrl+a H` - Log all output of current screen to a log file
- `ctrl+a space` - Change terminals within current screen
- `ctrl+a :sessionname name` - Rename current screen to "name"
- `ctrl+a d` - Detach from current screen, like exit but keeps the terminal for reattaching later on
