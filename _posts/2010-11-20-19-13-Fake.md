[Fake](http://fakeapp.com) is a really beautiful way of testing an interface dynamically.

Doesn’t seem to be very cross browser so you’d have to be careful but still, the use cases should be easy to find. First thing that comes to mind is browsing through a webshop, adding products from the right category and check if you really got those special offers based on the cart’s contents.

Wow.
