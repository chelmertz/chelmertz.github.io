Today I tried out ruby for the first time. The outcome is a helper for crossword like puzzles: <strong>say-what.rb</strong>. Usage:

    $ ruby say-what.rb
    What letters do you have?
    car
    Words built from your given letters 'car':
    1. ar
    2. arc
    3. car

Ruby's syntax is pretty awesome but not as intuitive as you might think. It's short though and reads out loud very well. You probably write large apps really fast after you get the hang of it, I hope I get to try it out for something more serious soon.
