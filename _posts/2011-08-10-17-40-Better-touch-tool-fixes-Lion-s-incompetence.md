Since Apple decided to mess up most trackpad swipes &amp; gestures, a program like <a href="http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=2507">Better touch tool</a> is greatly appreciated. It took me about a minute to download it and set a precious global setting: swiping four fingers should show the desktop.

Thank you, <a href="http://www.boastr.de/">boastr.net </a>:)

By the way, help Apple notice that things are wrong by <a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html">submitting feedback</a>.
