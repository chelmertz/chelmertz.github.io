Since Apple decided to mess up most trackpad swipes & gestures, a program like [Better touch tool](http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=2507) is greatly appreciated. It took me about a minute to download it and set a precious global setting: swiping four fingers should show the desktop.

Thank you, [boastr.net ](http://www.boastr.de/):)
