- make their *display order* count, be consistent
- avoid *reoccurring phrases* (use alive headings/icons instead of “Information”, “Settings”, “About”)
- *never use general wordings* (like “Ok”, “Cancel”, “Abort”) - *use active phrasing* (like “Store my information”, “Place order”, “Annul reclamation”)
- *use words humans understand*, not machines ("Save location" vs "Store latitude & longitude in memory until cookie dies"), always use a metaphor belonging to the user’s mental model of the current situation
- *differentiate the primary choice of many* for example by letting a “cancel editing”-button become an `<a>`-element while keeping the "save information"-button more button-like; different sizes and colours are alternatives as well
- let the user confirm their lesser-important-actions by *adding an undo-button* and confirm their more-important-actions *before the action’s taken place* with a confirm-dialog or checkbox
