I'd recommend everybody to try out [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/), an app that looks like this:

Alfred let's you start any app (image above) or  trigger apps through text input, for example _searching songs on Spotify without having to start it first_.

You open the quicklaunch window with `⌘+space` and start typing, and Alfred will fetch you what you're thinking about. It's fast.

## Launchy - an alternative for Linux and Windows users

[Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/) is really the same thing, it works as a charm.

## Why I prefer apps providing keyboard shortcuts for everything

- It's fast, I always prefer to leave the mouse (-pad) for as long as possible
- It thinks for me, the auto completion doesn't even need me to remember more than a letter or two of the app I'm looking for
- The desktop/dock is much less cluttered since icons becomes kind of unnecessary
- All keyboard, no mouse makes you look like a hacker and thereby you <em>are</em> more professional
