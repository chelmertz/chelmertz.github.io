The options I have as a recipient of emails is to mark an unwanted one as spam and never receive it again, or being nice trying to find and follow the link "Unsubscribe here" in the emails body.

If that link leads me to a login page, I won't bother and instead close the page and mark it as spam. If it asks me to confirm the action, it's fine, and so is automatic affirmation. Feel free to send me an email (which I know will be the last) saying what I did and how to inverse it. The process of unsubscribing should take 10 seconds top or you'll be marked as spam. Sorry.
