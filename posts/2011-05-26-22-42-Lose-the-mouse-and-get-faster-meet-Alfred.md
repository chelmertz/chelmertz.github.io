I'd recommend everybody to try out <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, an app that looks like this:

Alfred let's you start any app (image above) or  trigger apps through text input, for example <em>searching songs on Spotify without having to start it first</em>.

You open the quicklaunch window with <kbd>⌘+space</kbd> and start typing, and Alfred will fetch you what you're thinking about. It's fast.
<h2>Launchy - an alternative for Linux and Windows users</h2>

<a title="Launchy" href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a> is really the same thing, it works as a charm.
<h2>Why I prefer apps providing keyboard shortcuts for everything</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It's fast, I always prefer to leave the mouse (-pad) for as long as possible</li>
	<li>It thinks for me, the auto completion doesn't even need me to remember more than a letter or two of the app I'm looking for</li>
	<li>The desktop/dock is much less cluttered since icons becomes kind of unnecessary</li>
	<li>All keyboard, no mouse makes you look like a hacker and thereby you <em>are</em> more professional</li>
</ul>
