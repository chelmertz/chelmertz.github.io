<ul>
	<li>make their <strong>display order</strong> count, be consistent</li>
	<li>avoid <strong>reoccurring phrases</strong> (use alive headings/icons instead of “Information”, “Settings”, “About”)</li>
	<li> <strong>never use general wordings</strong> (like “Ok”, “Cancel”, “Abort”) - <strong>use active phrasing</strong> (like “Store my information”, “Place order”, “Annul reclamation”)</li>
	<li> <strong>use words humans understand</strong>, not machines (“Save location” vs “Store latitude &amp; longitude in memory until cookie dies”), always use a metaphor belonging to the user’s mental model of the current situation</li>
	<li> <strong>differentiate the primary choice of many</strong> for example by letting a “cancel editing”-button become an &lt;a&gt;-element while keeping the “save information”-button more button-like; different sizes and colours are alternatives as well</li>
	<li>let the user confirm their lesser-important-actions by <strong>adding an undo-button</strong> and confirm their more-important-actions <strong>before the action’s taken place</strong> with a confirm-dialog or checkbox</li>
</ul>
