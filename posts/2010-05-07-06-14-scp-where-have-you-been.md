Until I’ve learned to love <code>sshfs</code>, there’s always <code>scp</code> to help out when you need to <em>download something from a remote SSH-connection</em>.

<code>scp username@remotehost.com:~/something_interesting.txt ./</code> works like a charm for downloading <code>something_interesting</code> to <code>pwd</code> (current dir).

Using Ubuntu before Mac is perfect.
