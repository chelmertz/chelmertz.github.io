          <p>I’ve fallen in love with Google Chrome in most ways. Not that Chrome’s anything extra, it’s rather that it’s not.</p>
<p>Everything is slimmed down, it’s super fast and it feels like it got less than half of both the competitors GUI (in a good sense) and their settings.</p>
<p>One of the best things about Chrome is the sense of versions. Background: I grew up with IE6, which still harasses my workplace’s usage statistics, the same app that MS doesn’t bother getting rid of (maybe they do, but as far as I know, they’ve yet to implement the subtle updating process of Chrome in IE 9).</p>
<p>Except being a wonder for us developers, the hidden update is good because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll never see the “Your app has been updated, please restart it/your system”. Take a minute and realize exactly how important this is to avoid if you’re targeting anything but a techie crowd. At best, you’ll annoy users, at worst you just lost them.</li>
<li><em>No compatibility issues</em> for the user (since developers are responsible for serving only the latest version).</li>
<li>Your app challenges your competitors app. <em>Your competitors app has to challenge both you and earlier versions of itself</em>. This could be applied to the cellphone industry where most companies release every.. I don’t even know, it’s ridiculous.</li>
<li>The release pattern is <em>used successfully in web based apps</em>. The web as a medium has won much simply by being able to provide background updates - new layouts can be pushed right away (don’t even get me started on ajax).</li>
<li>If an update is seamless and invisible, you could make a <em>rollback seamless</em> and invisible.</li>
<li><em>Minor changes</em> are pushed out more easily, a hotfix could take 15 seconds to download but make a large part of your users more satisfied with your app.</li>
</ul>
